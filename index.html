    <p id="section1">Topic sentences are similar to mini thesis statements. Like a thesis statement, a topic sentence
        has a
        specific main point. Whereas the thesis is the main point of the essay, the topic sentence is the main
        point of the paragraph. Like the thesis statement, a topic sentence has a unifying function. But a thesis
        statement or topic sentence alone doesn’t guarantee unity. An essay is unified if all the paragraphs relate to
        the thesis, whereas a paragraph is unified if all the sentences relate to the topic sentence. Note: Not all
        paragraphs
        need topic sentences. In particular, opening and closing paragraphs, which serve different functions from body
        paragraphs,
        generally don’t have topic sentences.</p>
